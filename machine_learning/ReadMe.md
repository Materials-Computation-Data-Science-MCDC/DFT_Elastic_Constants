This folder contains the saved, trained models and a python code that can be used to predict on a structure file provided by the user. There are four folders here. The "ml_models" folder contains all of the elastic constants, bulk and shear moduli, and Voigt-Reuss-Hill Young's modulus machine learning models. "The output" folder contains output examples when running the "elastic_constants_PREDICT.py" code for the given data in the "testing_data" folder. Furthermore, there is a virtual environments "requirements.txt" file that one can use to create a similar virtual environment for the python code to work properly.
